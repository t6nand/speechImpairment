# speechImpairment
This is the soul of Electronic support system for Speech Impairment. It contains code that can be used for look-up table based sign language's signature signal matching using MSP430 mixed signal processor and 3-axis accelerometers along with EMG sensors. This also includes simulation work in matlab.

To run and test MSP430 code you can either use Arduino IDE or Energia IDE connected to your MCU board. Connect your board using 38400 or more baud rates for better results.
